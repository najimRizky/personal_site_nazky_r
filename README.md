Nazky is a personal personal website that I created with the aim of introducing myself like a resume but in the form of a website. The name of the website Nazky is the result of combining two words taken from my own name, namely <b><i>Na</i></b>jim Ri<b><i>zky</i></b>. The main concept of Nazky is "scrolling navigation", namely navigation that does not move pages but only uses scrolls. The goal is to make it easier for users to get existing information.

  The design on this website is originally made by me. There is no template used in making this website's UI. All designs are the result of my own research from various sources. Besides that, on this website there are also several animation components that I made with the framer motion library. Fun fact, this my first most animated website I've ever worked on. The animations can give an interactive impression. The Website is also fully responsive, so it can be accessed on any device.
